## Supported languages

- `en` (default)
- `ru`
- `vi`
- `bz`
- `de`
- `cz` should be supported as it's contributed in `lydiahallie`'s repository, but in current version there are issues parsing the Markdown for this language

Please note that not all languages have the same set of questions, the reference is `en`.
